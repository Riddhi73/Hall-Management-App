# NB
Our project codebase is in the master branch
# Unimplemented Features
- Payment gateway(finding updated library)
- Extending Hall Manager not only to hall students but also to the mess students
- Hall students give away their books, used items like T-scale, box and Hall Manager can be handy in this case. It will store various information about used product and           students can see those items. They can also post and buy items online.
- Implementing medical emergencies like delivering medicine to sick students
- Creating online library system
